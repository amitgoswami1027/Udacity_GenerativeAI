Whatever the outfit (or season, for that matter!), jewellery presents an accessible way to make your existing wares feel more current, and new for spring is a piece that will make your basic tops and shirts feel significantly fresher. Long, drop-like earrings that reached the shoulder were easily the most prevalent jewellery trend out there and came in various guises.
