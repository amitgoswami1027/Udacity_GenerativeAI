## Project Introduction
Lightweight fine-tuning is one of the most important techniques for adapting foundation models, because it allows you to modify foundation models for your needs without needing substantial computational resources.

In this project, you will apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library.

### Project Summary
In this project, you will bring together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, you will:

* Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
* Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
* Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and #compare its performance to the original model

### Valuable Feedback Details
Congratulations Student! üéâ

I'm thrilled to announce that you've successfully completed the project on "Applying Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model." Your implementation showcases a deep understanding of the fine-tuning process, and the utilization of the recommended configuration adds a layer of sophistication to your work.

Furthermore, your meticulous effort in comparing the results demonstrates a clear and insightful evaluation of the fine-tuned model against the original version. This thorough comparison not only validates the effectiveness of the fine-tuning but also underscores your dedication to delivering high-quality and well-evaluated machine learning models.

Keep up the outstanding work, and once again, congratulations on this achievement! Your dedication and proficiency in applying lightweight fine-tuning techniques are truly praiseworthy. Well done! üöÄüëè
