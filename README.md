## Now it's your turn
Can you find a question that the LLM cannot answer? Try to stump the LLM by asking it a question that you think it should be able to answer, but it cannot. Sometimes this can be hard, because the commercial LLM offerings are continually improving their models to handle different types of questions more gracefully, and often, if an LLM cannot answer a question, it will simply say something like "I don't know" or "I don't understand".

Spend a few minutes finding a question that the LLM cannot answer. Then, write down the question and the LLM's response in the cell below.

## Generation Algorithms
Generation algorithms are incredible tools that allow AI to create text and images that seem amazingly human-like. By understanding and applying these smart algorithms, AI can generate new content by building upon what it knows, just like filling in missing puzzle pieces.

Technical Terms Explained:
Autoregressive text generation: Autoregressive text generation is like a game where the computer guesses the next word in a sentence based on the words that came before it. It keeps doing this to make full sentences.

Latent space decoding: Imagine if you had a map of all the possible images you could create, with each point on the map being a different image. Latent space decoding is like picking a point on that map and bringing the image at that point to life.

Diffusion models: Diffusion models start with a picture that's full of random dots like TV static, and then they slowly clean it up, adding bits of the actual picture until it looks just like a real photo or painting

## What Is a Foundation Model
A foundation model is a powerful AI tool that can do many different things after being trained on lots of diverse data. These models are incredibly versatile and provide a solid base for creating various AI applications, like a strong foundation holds up different kind of buildings. By using a foundation model, we have a strong starting point for building specialized AI tasks.

## The GLUE Benchmarks
The GLUE benchmarks serve as an essential tool to assess an AI's grasp of human language, covering diverse tasks, from grammar checking to complex sentence relationship analysis. By putting AI models through these varied linguistic challenges, we can gauge their readiness for real-world tasks and uncover any potential weaknesses.

Semantic Equivalence: When different phrases or sentences convey the same meaning or idea.

Textual Entailment: The relationship between text fragments where one fragment follows logically from the other.

SuperGlue is designed as a successor to the original GLUE benchmark. It's a more advanced benchmark aimed at presenting even more challenging language understanding tasks for AI models. Created to push the boundaries of what AI can understand and process in natural language, SuperGlue emerged as models began to achieve human parity on the GLUE benchmark. It also features a public leaderboard, facilitating the direct comparison of models and enabling the tracking of progress over time.

## What Is Adaptation
Adaptation in AI is a crucial step to enhance the capabilities of foundation models, allowing them to cater to specific tasks and domains. This process is about tailoring pre-trained AI systems with new data, ensuring they perform optimally in specialized applications and respect privacy constraints. Reaping the benefits of adaptation leads to AI models that are not only versatile but also more aligned with the unique needs of organizations and industries.

Fine-tuning: This is a technique in machine learning where an already trained model is further trained (or tuned) on a new, typically smaller, dataset for better performance on a specific task.




## Training Generative AI Models

## Nanodegree from Udacity in Generative AI
The exciting world of training generative AI models is about teaching computers to create new content, like text or images, by learning from huge datasets. This training helps AI to understand and recreate the complex patterns found in human language and visual arts. The process is intricate but immensely rewarding, leading to AI that can generate amazingly realistic outputs. Generation algorithms are incredible tools that allow AI to create text and images that seem amazingly human-like. By understanding and applying these smart algorithms, AI can generate new content by building upon what it knows, just like filling in missing puzzle pieces.
