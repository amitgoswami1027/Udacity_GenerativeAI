# GenerativeAI - Nanodegree
Nanodegree from Udacity in Generative AI
The exciting world of training generative AI models is about teaching computers to create new content, like text or images, by learning from huge datasets. This training helps AI to understand and recreate the complex patterns found in human language and visual arts. The process is intricate but immensely rewarding, leading to AI that can generate amazingly realistic outputs. Generation algorithms are incredible tools that allow AI to create text and images that seem amazingly human-like. By understanding and applying these smart algorithms, AI can generate new content by building upon what it knows, just like filling in missing puzzle pieces.

** Autoregressive text generation: Autoregressive text generation is like a game where the computer guesses the next word in a sentence based on the words that came before it. It keeps doing this to make full sentences.

** Latent space decoding: Imagine if you had a map of all the possible images you could create, with each point on the map being a different image. Latent space decoding is like picking a point on that map and bringing the image at that point to life.

** Diffusion models: Diffusion models start with a picture that's full of random dots like TV static, and then they slowly clean it up, adding bits of the actual picture until it looks just like a real photo or painting.
